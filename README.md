These are either working files for my template/module mods at the [Cantonese Wikipedia](https://zh-yue.wikipedia.org)
or files I’ve already committed over there.
They need to be kept here
so that I can pull up a diff
when it becomes necessary to re-patch any template or module
(such as when a module gets upgraded).

Many of the files will not have been written by me (but the mods are),
while others will be.
If you need to know which files are written by whom
you can check the logs yourself on Wikipedia.

My Wikipedia name is my old OCADU student email name.
The email no longer exists but you can look up my thesis and find it out yourself.

### Summary in Cantonese

呢啲係我喺粵文維基改模或者改模組嘅 working files 或者改過嘅檔案嘅紀錄，因為喺維基好難 keep track 改咗乜，如果淨係喺嗰便做嘢，嗰便啲模或者模組換咗新版我會唔識點加返啲改咗嘅嘢入去。

呢度大多數嘅模或者模組都唔會係我開，不過有部分會係。要知你可以自己去維基睇返紀錄。
