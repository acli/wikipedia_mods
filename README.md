These are either working files for my template/module mods at the yue Wikipedia
or files I’ve already committed over there.
They need to be kept here
so that I can pull up a diff
when it becomes necessary to re-patch any template or module
(such as when a module gets upgraded).

Many of the files will not have been written by me (but the mods are),
while others will be.
If you need to know which files are written by who
you can check the logs yourself on Wikipedia.

呢啲係我喺粵文維基改模或者改模組嘅 working files 或者改過嘅檔案嘅紀錄，因為喺維基好難 keep track 改咗乜。

呢度大多數嘅模或者模組都唔會係我開，不過有部分會係。要知你可以自己去維基睇返紀錄。
